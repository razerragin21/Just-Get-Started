# Just-Get-Started
I made this simple To Do application in python to help me get things done, at the moment it is simple but I have bigger plans for in the future, please feel free to mess around with it or contribute! :)


Libraries used:
- Tkinter
- Playsound

Images stored in Image folder
Sounds stored in SFX folder

Currently only supports Windows OS and is non-resizeable, plan is to make it run on other OS's and have customizable settings such as options for sound and program resolution.
